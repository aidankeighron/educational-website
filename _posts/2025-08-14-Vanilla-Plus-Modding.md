## About the project

Welcome to the Vanilla+ Modding tutorial! This is the first tutorial of a series where we will teach you how to make your own minecraft mod. Additionally this tutorial works with both Mac and Windows.

**What you will make in this Tutorial:**

- How to setup your enviornment to start
- How to create custom items from materials to armor / tools
- How to create custom blocks / ores
- How to create crafting recipes and loot drops

**Further Possibilities** 

After this tutorial you could easily make your own Vanilla minecraft mod, and have the resources to be able to learn more and make even more indepth mods as well. 

## Disclaimer

**This series assumes a couple things**

- You have at least *some* knowledge on minecraft
- You have experience in Java
- You have an IDE installed and ready (Intellij is what I reccomend for this but others work just fine)

 > Note: Technically you do not need Minecraft installed on your machine to make this work, as Forge (the mod loader we are using) will download the necessary Minecraft client/server jars and assets from Mojangâ€™s servers. I did not test this however so do this at your own risk. 
 {: .prompt-warning }

If you do not have Intellij I highly reccomend you get it, plus you get the full version for free as a student.

 [Click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) to request your license **additionally you will sign in using your MSU email and password**

## Setup your Enviornment

### Setting up your JDK 17

First thing you will need installed is the proper JDK (Java Development Kit) specifically you will need **JDK 17** 

*Why JDK 17 specifically?* 

Because we are using Minecraft version 1.20.1

*Why are we using 1.20.1?*

Because this tutorial is meant to be used for both MacOS and Windows, I am sure newer versions can run fine on Mac but this specific version worked immediately for Mac while other versions always had something go wrong.
