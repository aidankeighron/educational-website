## About the project

Welcome to the Vanilla+ Modding tutorial! This is the first tutorial of a series where we will teach you how to make your own minecraft mod. Additionally this tutorial works with both Mac and Windows.

**What you will make in this Tutorial:**

- How to setup your enviornment to start
- How to create custom items from materials to armor / tools
- How to create custom blocks / ores
- How to create crafting recipes and loot drops

**Further Possibilities** 

After this tutorial you could easily make your own Vanilla minecraft mod, and have the resources to be able to learn more and make even more indepth mods as well. 

## Disclaimer

**This series assumes a couple things**

- You have at least *some* knowledge on minecraft
- You have experience in Java
- You have an IDE installed and ready (Intellij is what I reccomend for this but others work just fine)

 > Note: Technically you do not need Minecraft installed on your machine to make this work, as Forge (the mod loader we are using) will download the necessary Minecraft client/server jars and assets from Mojangâ€™s servers. I did not test this however so do this at your own risk. 
 {: .prompt-warning }

If you do not have Intellij I **highly reccomend** you get it, plus you get the full version for free as a student. Reason being I am using Intellij and I will make the tutorial around using Intellij for ease.

 [Click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) to request your license **additionally you will sign in using your MSU email and password** 
 
And [click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to install. 

For those still struggling [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bGt1v887tA).

## Setup your Enviornment

### Setting up your JDK 17

First thing you will need installed is the proper JDK (Java Development Kit) specifically you will need **JDK 17** 

*Why JDK 17 specifically?* 

> Because we are using Minecraft version 1.20.1, this version of minecraft uses JDK 17, other JDK versions will not work because of this

*Why are we using 1.20.1 when newer versions are out?*

> Because I want the setup to be as trouble free as possible for the most people. Specifically MacOS seemed to have trouble with newer versions, while this version worked right out of the box for MacOS.

So to download the JDK 17 [click here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17). Download based on your OS and go through all ther prompts it gives you, and you should all set up to go!

 > I will not cover downloading the JRE or other Java Concepts, if unaware of what the JRE is or do not have prior Java experience I HIGHLY suggest you learn Java before moving forward. 
 {: .prompt-warning }

### Download the Mod Pack

Next we need to download the actual **mod development kit (mdk)**. [Click here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html) to visit the download page.

Once you are there you will see **Latest, and Recommended**, both should work fine, the safer route of course is **Recommended**. 

In these two boxes you will see 
- A big box that says `Installer`
- Top right box that says `Changelog`
- Bottom right box that say `Mdk`

> Click the box that says `Mdk`, this will take you to a screen that is *a large ad* from AdFocus, in other words **DO NOT CLICK DOWNLOAD IT IS A SCAM / VIRUS**. Instead click **Skip Ad** on the top right corner when it shows up and it will download for you after that.
{: .prompt-danger}

> Sadly when modding with minecraft you will likely always have this, whether it be downloading a new mod, resource pack, shaderpack, etc. I highly reccomend a good ad blocker so these never show up.
{: .prompt-info}


After you click **Skip Ad** it will download **forge-1.20.1-47.4.0-mdk.zip**.

Unpack this folder and rename to whatever you want your mod to be called.

**This is optional but here are some things you can delete within your folder:**

- changelog.txt
- CREDITS.txt
- LICENSE.txt
- README.txt

**Congrats!** You are now just 1 step away from starting to code, next step is setting up Intellij 


### Set up Intellij

> Of course if you are using another IDE still go through this section, I will cover changes to gradle.properties, settings.gradle, etc. But do know the actual running of the project and using Gradle is completely on you.

> There is a lot of things that go wrong here for different reasons. Try to troubleshoot the errors yourself, if you are stuck feel free to reach out to me via Discord (**Johnny S** on the 2 Week Projects server). 
{: .prompt-info}

First off make sure you have Intellij installed, either the *full version* or *Community Edition* work just fine.

When you launch Intellij click `Open`

Select the **unzipped Mdk** to open, go through the prompts, it may ask if you *Trust this Project?* in which say yes. 

Now that it is open, you want to make sure you have the right JDK chosen. 

- Go to **Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle**
- Here you will see **Gradle JVM**, here you will see a JDK selected. Make sure it is `temurin-17` as that is what we downloaded.

> If you do not see anything selected / there is no option for `temurin-17` likely that means something went wrong with your installation. Try the steps again to install the JDK, make sure the installation is in your PATH and JAVA_HOME variables, etc.
{: .prompt-warning}

Now that we have the correct JDK installed lets go back to the Main Window of your project. You will see an **Elephant symbol (Gradle logo)**

Click on it to open it (if you have not already) then in the window/tab that opens, you should a refresh icon on the top left corner of the tab. When you click that it will build the project

When you do this there should be **no errors**, you should see a **couple warnings** but those are not an issue. 

> **Optional But Helpful:** Right click ont the File tree, click *Appearence*, then disable *Flatten Modules* and *Flatten Packages*. This will make it so it shows ALL folders instead of combining folders like so `com.folder1.folder2`
{: .prompt-tip}

## Set up the Mod Project

**Congrats!** The hardest part of this tutorial should be over, if you managed to get here with no errors or setbacks, not only do I applaud you but I am jealous. 

First off navigate to `ExampleMod.java`, here you will find a whole lot of jargon that we do not need.

**Feel free to remove:**
- Any variable under `MODID` and `LOGGER`
- The function bodies of `commonSetup`, `addCreative`, `onServerStarting`, and `onClientSetup`

The contents of the file should look like this

```java
@Mod(ExampleMod.MOD_ID)
public class ExampleMod
{
    // Define mod id in a common place for everything to reference
    public static final String MOD_ID = "examplemod";
    // Directly reference a slf4j logger
    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogUtils.getLogger();

    public ExampleMod(FMLJavaModLoadingContext context)
    {
        IEventBus modEventBus = context.getModEventBus();

        // Register the commonSetup method for modloading
        modEventBus.addListener(this::commonSetup);

        // Register ourselves for server and other game events we are interested in
        MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(this);

        // Register the item to a creative tab
        modEventBus.addListener(this::addCreative);

        // Register our mod's ForgeConfigSpec so that Forge can create and load the config file for us
        context.registerConfig(ModConfig.Type.COMMON, Config.SPEC);
    }

    private void commonSetup(final FMLCommonSetupEvent event)
    {
    }

    // Add the example block item to the building blocks tab
    private void addCreative(BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent event)
    {
    }

    // You can use SubscribeEvent and let the Event Bus discover methods to call
    @SubscribeEvent
    public void onServerStarting(ServerStartingEvent event)
    {
    }

    // You can use EventBusSubscriber to automatically register all static methods in the class annotated with @SubscribeEvent
    @Mod.EventBusSubscriber(modid = MOD_ID, bus = Mod.EventBusSubscriber.Bus.MOD, value = Dist.CLIENT)
    public static class ClientModEvents
    {
        @SubscribeEvent
        public static void onClientSetup(FMLClientSetupEvent event)
        {
        }
    }
}
```
{: file="ExampleMod.java" }
{: .nolineno }

### Updating Mod ID and Gradle files

#### Mod ID

First up, your **Mod ID**, as you can see in the file above we have the `MOD_ID` variable, this ID is to uniquely identify your mod, it has specific requirements, **it can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes** I named mine to `tutorialcraft` so keep that in mind when seeing my code

```java
public static final String MOD_ID = "tutorialmod";
```
{: .nolineno}

#### Mod classname

Next we also have the class name and filename being `ExampleMod` still, rename these to be like your `MOD_ID` except **the class and file name can contain uppercase letters**

I changed mine to be `TutorialCraft`. However there is quite a few areas where this is used. The safest way to change the class name is to:

 **highlight the current class name > right click > click refactor.** 
 
 This way it will be across the file, additionally there will be an error because your file name should be name of the class inside, so make sure to update you file name accordingly.

#### Fixing Config file

You might have noticed that your config file has errors around these lines:

```java
new ResourceLocation(itemName)
```
{: .nolineno }

That is because the new version of Forge has `ResourceLocation` use static functions instead of being an object

Change all these instances to this:

```java
ResourceLocation.tryParse(itemName)
```
{: .nolineno }

#### What your files should look like now

> Be careful if copy and pasting I **did not include any class import statements**
{: .prompt-warning}

```java
@Mod.EventBusSubscriber(modid = TutorialCraft.MOD_ID, bus = Mod.EventBusSubscriber.Bus.MOD)
public class Config
{
    private static final ForgeConfigSpec.Builder BUILDER = new ForgeConfigSpec.Builder();

    private static final ForgeConfigSpec.BooleanValue LOG_DIRT_BLOCK = BUILDER
            .comment("Whether to log the dirt block on common setup")
            .define("logDirtBlock", true);

    private static final ForgeConfigSpec.IntValue MAGIC_NUMBER = BUILDER
            .comment("A magic number")
            .defineInRange("magicNumber", 42, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

    public static final ForgeConfigSpec.ConfigValue<String> MAGIC_NUMBER_INTRODUCTION = BUILDER
            .comment("What you want the introduction message to be for the magic number")
            .define("magicNumberIntroduction", "The magic number is... ");

    // a list of strings that are treated as resource locations for items
    private static final ForgeConfigSpec.ConfigValue<List<? extends String>> ITEM_STRINGS = BUILDER
            .comment("A list of items to log on common setup.")
            .defineListAllowEmpty("items", List.of("minecraft:iron_ingot"), Config::validateItemName);

    static final ForgeConfigSpec SPEC = BUILDER.build();

    public static boolean logDirtBlock;
    public static int magicNumber;
    public static String magicNumberIntroduction;
    public static Set<Item> items;

    private static boolean validateItemName(final Object obj)
    {
        return obj instanceof final String itemName && ForgeRegistries.ITEMS.containsKey( ResourceLocation.tryParse(itemName));
    }

    @SubscribeEvent
    static void onLoad(final ModConfigEvent event)
    {
        logDirtBlock = LOG_DIRT_BLOCK.get();
        magicNumber = MAGIC_NUMBER.get();
        magicNumberIntroduction = MAGIC_NUMBER_INTRODUCTION.get();

        // convert the list of strings into a set of items
        items = ITEM_STRINGS.get().stream()
                .map(itemName -> ForgeRegistries.ITEMS.getValue(ResourceLocation.tryParse(itemName)))
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }
}
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Config.java" }

```java
@Mod(TutorialCraft.MOD_ID)
public class TutorialCraft
{
    // Define mod id in a common place for everything to reference
    public static final String MOD_ID = "tutorialmod";
    // Directly reference a slf4j logger
    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogUtils.getLogger();

    public TutorialCraft(FMLJavaModLoadingContext context)
    {
        IEventBus modEventBus = context.getModEventBus();

        // Register the commonSetup method for modloading
        modEventBus.addListener(this::commonSetup);

        // Register ourselves for server and other game events we are interested in
        MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(this);

        // Register the item to a creative tab
        modEventBus.addListener(this::addCreative);

        // Register our mod's ForgeConfigSpec so that Forge can create and load the config file for us
        context.registerConfig(ModConfig.Type.COMMON, Config.SPEC);
    }

    private void commonSetup(final FMLCommonSetupEvent event)
    {
    }

    // Add the example block item to the building blocks tab
    private void addCreative(BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent event)
    {
    }

    // You can use SubscribeEvent and let the Event Bus discover methods to call

    {
        @SubscribeEvent

        {
        }
    }
}
```

{: .nolineno }

### Parchment

Mojang obfuscates code before they release a new version of Minecraft, so in order to make modding significantly easier and readable we use **ParchmentMC mappings**

> Parchment mappings are the standard, although Mojang does come out with their own mappings they are usually incomplete which is why Parchment mappings is the more commonly used ones 
{: .prompt-info }

In order to use ParchmentMC mappings we have a couple steps to use

Add this segment into `settings.gradle`

```groovy
 pluginManagement {
     repositories {
         maven { url = 'https://maven.parchmentmc.org' } // Add this line
     }
 }
```
{: .nolineno }


Update these segments in your `build.gradle`

```groovy
 plugins {
     // This should be below the net.minecraftforge.gradle plugin
     id 'org.parchmentmc.librarian.forgegradle' version '1.+'
 }

  minecraft {
    // update this line (first line under minecraft)
     mappings channel: 'parchment', version: '2023.09.03-1.20.1'
 }
```
{: .nolineno }


Lastly in `gradle.properties` update these two lines

```properties
mapping_channel=parchment
mapping_version=2023.09.03-1.20.1
```
{: .nolineno }

Feel free to change any of these in `gradle.properties` as well. This is wear you determine the author, version, description, etc. 

```properties
# The unique mod identifier for the mod. Must be lowercase in English locale. Must fit the regex [a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,63}
# Must match the String constant located in the main mod class annotated with @Mod.
mod_id=tutorialcraft
# The human-readable display name for the mod.
mod_name=Tutorial Craft
# The license of the mod. Review your options at https://choosealicense.com/. All Rights Reserved is the default.
mod_license=All Rights Reserved
# The mod version. See https://semver.org/
mod_version=1.0.0
# The group ID for the mod. It is only important when publishing as an artifact to a Maven repository.
# This should match the base package used for the mod sources.
# See https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html
mod_group_id=net.twoweek.tutorialcraft
# The authors of the mod. This is a simple text string that is used for display purposes in the mod list.
mod_authors=JohnStouffer
# The description of the mod. This is a simple multiline text string that is used for display purposes in the mod list.
mod_description=Make your own MC Mod! \nBasic mod that adds a few items, mobs, and blocks.
```

### Congrats!

You are finally done configuring everything!

To make sure that all that you have done is working run this command in your terminal

```bash
./gradlew genIntellijRuns
```
{: .nolineno }

> You may have a ton of warnings, that is okay, we just want to make sure we still have that `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`
{: .prompt-warning }

This command will bring up the a bunch of different things you can run in your **right side gradle tab**. Specifically **runClient** is what we will use to test our mod. Feel free to run this too make sure all is working.

Now it is time to actually to do some modding!

First up we are going to make **items**

## Make First Item

I reccomend you make your own items that you want instead of copying my items, however this requires you to make your artwork so I will still give you all my items. 

First you need to make a new folder inside your mod folder

ie. if you mod is `tutorialcraft` then put it in `net.twoweek.tutorialcraft` folder

name this folder `items`

in this items folder create the class `ModItems.java` this is a **central registry class** to keep track of all items that your mod wants to add.

First up, **Make a DeferredRegister** of the Forge `Items` inside of the `ModItems` class

```java
public static final DeferredRegister<Item> ITEMS =
    DeferredRegister.create(ForgeRegistries.ITEMS, TutorialCraft.MOD_ID);
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="ModItems.java" }

### What is a DeferredRegister?

A DeferredRegister is Forge's **helper to add "things" its registry**, specifically right now we are using it to add items.

Specifically it allows us to **make new items and then add them to the registry**

`ForgeRegistries.ITEMS` right now is all the built in items before we add this mod, and this is where we add all of our items to be in the game.

We make it `static` so thereâ€™s only one copy shared by the whole mod, and `final` so it never gets replaced.

### Making the item variable

Each item is a `RegistryObject` which is Forge's wrapper around anything that you register into the game

Here is an example to add a **Ruby item** into the game

```java
public static final RegistryObject<Item> RUBY = ITEMS.register(
    "ruby",                                 // The name of the item
    () -> new Item(new Item.Properties())); // Passing the Supplier
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="ModItems.java" }

**What does the second line do?** 

Forge wants us to **pass a Supplier to create an item**, rather than just the item itself. Additionally items have many different properties. Calling `Item.Properties()` calls all of the default properties of a typical item.

You are able to override this default properties using chaning functions as well. We will discuss that more later. 

### Register using the ModBus

In `TutorialCraft.java` we have `modEventBus`

**What is modEventBus?**
- An event bus that is dedicated for startup events of a mod
- This makes it useful to register things into the bus 

While above we registered the item into the register, this portion is registering the items as a startup event to be added when the game starts.

So in `ModItems.java` we are going to add a function to register our `ITEMS` in a startup event

```java
// Add this somewhere within the ModItems class
public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {
    ITEMS.register(eventBus);
}
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="ModItems.java" }

Next go back to `TutorialCraft.java`

Inside of the **constructor** we need to register the ModBus with the new items 

```java
public TutorialCraft(FMLJavaModLoadingContext context)
{
    IEventBus modEventBus = context.getModEventBus();

    ModItems.register(modEventBus); // <- Add this line
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="TutorialCraft.java" }
